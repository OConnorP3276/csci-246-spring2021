% ============================================

Write a short (1-2 paragraph) biography of Leonhard Euler.
\textbf{In your own words}, describe who they are and why they are important in
the history of computer science.

If you use external resources, please provide
proper citations. If you do not use external sources, please write ``I did not
use any sources to write this biography'' as the last sentence of the
biography.

\paragraph{Answer}

Leonhard Euler was extremely diverse learner and expert, classified as a
mathematician, physicist, astronomer, geographer, logician, and engineer.
Euler started his life in Switzerland in 1707 where he originally started his
professional career as a rural clergyman. With proof of great aptitude in
mathematics. Johan Bernoulli, of Bernoulli principle, recognized this greatness
in the making and pulled him to study under him. After studying under Bernoulli,
Euler attended University of Basel in his home town. After earning his masters
in his teens, Euler moved to Russia and served in the navy. After serving in the
navy he returned to the educational system in order to spread his knowledge as a
professor in physics and mathematics.

During this period, Euler made expansive contributions to mathematics(geometry,
calculus, trigonometry, algebra, and number theory) and physics. Euler was the
first to introduce the notation of f(x) and popularized $\pi$ to denote the ratio
of a circle's circumference to its diameter. Euler's contribution to graph theory
and topography is a large contribution to the current systems that are in place
for route finding applications and any mapping application. Euler made these
discovery through investigating Königsberg Bridge Problem and Knight's Tour Problem.
The Königsberg Bridge Problem investigated whether it was possible to walk around
the entirety of Königsberg using all of the seven bridges using each bridge exactly
once. Euler concluded that this was in fact impossible and displayed this by picturing
the landmasses as nodes and the bridges as edges. Further Euler proved that if
the land masses/nodes were an even number with an odd number of bridges this
would be always possible. The Knights Tour Problem is similar
in that it can be represented as a graph with nodes and edges but rather the
intention to move the knight to each space exactly once using the class knight
move. This initial graph theory creation is found in many complex fields of computer
science currently such as telephone switching systems and the investigation of
the Four Color Theory.
